# styleguide

## General Text
* Text must be in literary present tense throughout. For example, "we predict the dependent variable" rather than "we predicted the dependent variable." Use past tense when describing historical events. For example, "investors sold shares in our sample" rather than "investors sell shares in our sample."
* Grammar, spelling, and punctuation corrections must be made.
* Bullet points or small roman numerals (e.g., (i), (ii), etc.) may be used to list items.
* Please use the following treatment: “See, for example, ...” rather than “See, e.g., ....” Similarly, use “..., that is, .....” rather than “..., i.e., .....” However, “(i.e., ...)” or “(e.g., ...)” is fine.
* Do not use italics on Latin. For example, “ceteris paribus” rather than “ceteris paribus.”
* The end of a sentence should be followed with two spaces, not a single space.

## Dates
* Dates should be written as “1980 to 1990” in the text. “1980–90” or “1980–1990” is okay for tables although it should be consistent.

## Exhibits
* Tables and Figures will be referred to as Exhibits.
* Numbering will be consecutive regardless of whether the Exhibit is a Table or Figure.  For example, the first table will be Exhibit 1 and the first figure will be Exhibit 2.

## Tables
* In general, tables should be self-contained, requiring no further information from other sources to make them understandable. However, if a table’s legend runs more than 300 words, lengthy details on variable construction should be located in a separate definitions table or appendix, with the legend indicating where the reader can find such details. The goal here is to shorten table legends and reduce redundancy across legends.
* Tables are numbered with Arabic numerals and must have a title and descriptive legend.
* The legend must define all variable notation (e.g., “∆WC is change in working capital”) and briefly explain what the table shows.
• Tables should be in portrait orientation, with up to 8 columns and 12-point text.

## Figures 
* Figures are numbered with Arabic numerals and must have a caption. There should also be a descriptive legend if necessary to explain what the figure shows or to define variable notation (as with tables, figure legends should direct the reader to a separate definitions table or appendix if lengthy, OR to a previous figure as appropriate).
* Figures must be camera-ready with all axes labeled.
* Please use color figures to enhance the readability.  However, figures must also be readable in black and white.  This means, shading and shapes should be used.

## Footnotes
* The number of footnotes must not exceed the number of pages within the article.
* Footnotes in tables should be limited to technical information such as levels of significance. All other information belongs in the legend. 

## References
References in the text are by author(s) name and date of publication. For example, Tufano (1996) or (Tufano (1996)).
* Use “et al.” when referencing a source with four or more authors. For example: (Leven et al. (1999)).
* All references mentioned in the text must be included in the list of references and vice versa.  References must be on a separate page at the end of the paper, unnumbered and double spaced.  References must include first names of all authors.
* References to data sources within the body of the paper or the tables should be italicized.
* Research/consulting firms do not need to be referenced.
* Personal communications should be left as footnotes.

## Appendices
* Appendices should be lettered A, B, C, etc.
* If there is only one appendix, there is no need to letter it A.
* Tables within an appendix should be lettered A.1, A.2, etc.
* Figures within an appendix should be numbered A.1, A.2, etc.
