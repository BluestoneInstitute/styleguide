# Bluestone Institute Style Guide
Bluestone Institute has adopted a “default” style for the presentation of our research.  The default style allows everyone to seamlessly flow from one project to the next.  It minimizes time spent re-formatting and other superficial tasks and returns focus (and budgets) to rigorous economic analysis.  Finally, consistently formatted results are a trademark of quality and professionalism.  

Academic journals may have their own style to which we will need to adopt prior to publication.  For this reason, some flexibility is needed to meet the needs of each research project.

# Project Administration

## Time Entry
Bluestone Institute does not currently have a time entry system.  However, Research Interns have committed some of their time each week to Bluestone Institute. We expect that commitment to be met. Tell your supervisor if you don’t have enough work to fulfill your commitment or if you have too much work in excess of your commitment.

## Folder Organization
Each project will have its own project folder on Dropbox and GitHub.  Sub-folders within the project folder should be organized consistently so that files can be located easily, even after significant time has passed.  

## Version Control

## Filenames

## Headers and Footers
Headers and footers are used to indicate proprietary and confidential information and the version of the document.  The header and footer of this document provide an example of the standard header and footer format.  

In the right corner of document headers, the version of the document (i.e. “DRAFT” or “REVISED”) and the date the document was created or updated (e.g. “DRAFT- 06/11/2015”) is recorded.  The date should be typed in the header instead of inserting automatically generated dates because inserted dates will be updated whenever the file is reopened.  In the left corner of document headers place the BRG logo.

As appropriate, the bottom left corner of the footer should contain “Privileged and Confidential” and “Tentative and Preliminary,” and the bottom right corner of the footer should contain “Attorney Work Product” and “Prepared at Request of Counsel.”  This is not always appropriate because not all of our work is privileged.  Also, depending upon the matter counsel may request alternative disclaimers that are specific to the case or a task associated with a case.

## Memos
The Community Memo template contains the standard memo style.  Associates generally write memos for two purposes: summarizing research or explaining an analysis for an audit.  When summarizing research, it is generally best to keep the memo short and to the point.  When explaining an analysis for an audit, it is important to explain the inputs, general methodology, and goal of the analysis, but not tell the auditor the specific processes that must be undertaken to conduct the analysis.  This allows for the auditor to develop his or her own approach to the project.  If two independently developed approaches lead to identical (or nearly so) results then it is typically assumed the analysis was performed correctly and without error.

# Reports and Papers

## General Text
* Text must be in literary present tense throughout. For example, "we predict the dependent variable" rather than "we predicted the dependent variable." Use past tense when describing historical events. For example, "investors sold shares in our sample" rather than "investors sell shares in our sample."
* Grammar, spelling, and punctuation corrections must be made.
* Bullet points or small roman numerals (e.g., (i), (ii), etc.) may be used to list items.
* Please use the following treatment: “See, for example, ...” rather than “See, e.g., ....” Similarly, use “..., that is, .....” rather than “..., i.e., .....” However, “(i.e., ...)” or “(e.g., ...)” is fine.
* Do not use italics on Latin. For example, “ceteris paribus” rather than "*ceteris paribus*".
* The end of a sentence should be followed with two spaces, not a single space.

## Page Numbers
Page numbers should be inserted into the center of the footer.  If the document has a cover page, the page numbering should start on the first page of content as opposed to the cover.

## Dates
* Dates should be written as “1980 to 1990” in the text. “1980–90” or “1980–1990” is okay for tables although it should be consistent.

## Exhibits
* Tables and Figures will be referred to as Exhibits.
* Numbering will be consecutive regardless of whether the Exhibit is a Table or Figure.  For example, the first table will be Exhibit 1 and the first figure will be Exhibit 2.
* Exhibits can be created in Excel, SAS, Stata, or other programs of your choice. Exhibits should be inserted into documents as pictures. To do this when pasting the graph or figure into Word, select the picture icon.

## Tables
* In general, tables should be self-contained, requiring no further information from other sources to make them understandable. However, if a table’s legend runs more than 300 words, lengthy details on variable construction should be located in a separate definitions table or appendix, with the legend indicating where the reader can find such details. The goal here is to shorten table legends and reduce redundancy across legends.
* Tables are numbered with Arabic numerals and must have a title and descriptive legend.
* The legend must define all variable notation (e.g., “∆WC is change in working capital”) and briefly explain what the table shows.
• Tables should be in portrait orientation, with up to 8 columns and 12-point text.

## Figures 
* Figures are numbered with Arabic numerals and must have a caption. There should also be a descriptive legend if necessary to explain what the figure shows or to define variable notation (as with tables, figure legends should direct the reader to a separate definitions table or appendix if lengthy, OR to a previous figure as appropriate).
* Figures must be camera-ready with all axes labeled.
* Please use color figures to enhance the readability.  However, figures must also be readable in black and white.  This means, shading and shapes should be used.

## Citations
As a matter of law, experts may only testify at trial and in deposition to topics and facts covered in their expert reports.  Footnotes are one way to have a broad scope of possible testimony without adding unnecessary length to the body of the report.  Likewise, citations to different branches of economic literature (including literature that is counter to the opinions in the text of the report) may provide an expert with the foundation to respond to questions and critiques from opposing counsel and experts.  It is for this reason that expert reports often contain a large number of footnotes.  Another reason for footnotes is that they provide prompting to the expert during deposition.  For example, if an expert is asked about a detail in their report, the expert may refer to the document cited in a footnote to jog their memory.  (If the expert brings a backup binder to deposition they may also look-up the cited document during deposition.)
In many cases, the footnotes cite to case documents (e.g. opposing expert reports, interrogatories), academic works (e.g. books, published papers), websites, and third party studies.  Regardless of what is being referenced, a citation is intended to provide the interested reader with enough information to follow up on the cited source.  While there are many different established styles available, the Community has chosen the Chicago Manual of Style as the default choice. 
It is paramount that pdf copies of all cited documents, papers, and websites be saved to the \07 Research\ folder in the case directory in an appropriate sub-directory.  This is especially true for websites which can change regularly.  Check to ensure PDFs of websites contain the URL and date accessed. The best way to ensure this occurs is to insert a textbox at the bottom of the first page of the PDF.   This is necessary because the URL that often appears automatically at the bottom of the page is incomplete and cannot be used in a citation. For bates numbered documents saved from Concordance, use a filename with the first and last bates number, and if it is an excerpt, specify the pages included, e.g. ABC00001-ABC00005_ABC00003-ABC0004 (The pdf contains a two page excerpt of a single five page document)
The general structure of a note is described by the Chicago Manual of Style as follows:
A footnote or an endnote generally lists the author, title, and factors publication, in that order.  Elements are separated by commas; the facts of publication are enclosed in parentheses.  Authors’ names are presented in standard order (first name first).  Titles are capitalized headline-style (see 8.157), unless they are in a foreign language (see 11.3).  Titles of larger works (e.g., books and journals) are italicized; titles of smaller works (e.g., chapters, articles) or unpublished works are presented in roman and enclosed in quotation marks (see 8.161).  Such terms as editor/edited by, translator/translated by, volume, and edition are abbreviated. [Rule 14.15]
